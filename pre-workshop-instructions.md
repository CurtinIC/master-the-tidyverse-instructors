Thank you for enrolling in Master the Tidyverse.  
 
Please bring a laptop to class that has the following installed:  
 
1. A recent version of R (~3.5.1), which is available for free at <cran.r-project.org>  
2. A recent version of RStudio IDE (~1.1.456), available for free at <www.rstudio.com/download>  
3. The R packages we will use, which you can install by connecting to the internet, opening R, and running:  
 
    install.packages(c("babynames", "formatR", "gapminder", "hexbin", "mgcv", "maps", "mapproj", "nycflights13", "rmarkdown", "tidyverse", "viridis")) 
 
4. The class materials, which can be downloaded at  
<https://github.com/rstudio/master-the-tidyverse/archive/master.zip>
 
And don't forget your power cord! 

Also, please sign up for a free RStudio Cloud account at <https://rstudio.cloud/>. On the day of the class, I'll provide you with an RStudio Cloud project that contains all of the course materials. We will use the software listed above only as an important backup should there be problems with the conference internet connection.

I look forward to meeting you!
